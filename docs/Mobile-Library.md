# Mobile Library
The Mobile Libraries are small, easy to include libraries that enable the user
to stream logs from their mobile application to the web server. All the user
needs to do is include the library, enter the server address and their API key,
and call a constructor.

There is currently support for two mobile platforms:
- [Android](Android)
- [iOS](iOS)

Sample mobile applications that use these libraries are also provided under
samples:
- [Sample Apps](Sample-Mobile-Apps)
